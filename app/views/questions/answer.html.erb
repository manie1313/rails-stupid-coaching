<%# The answer.html.erb will display the question you ask your coach
as well as the coachâ€™s answer. The controller will need to read the question
 from params and compute an instance
variable @answer for the view to display.
 Here are two requests that you should be able to handle: %>

<%# <erb>@question</erb>
<erb>@answer</erb> %>

<div class="container">
  <% @questions.each_with_index do |question, index| %>
    <div class="card mt-5">
        <p><%= question %></p>
      <p><%= @answers[index] %></p>
    </div>
  <% end %>
</div>

<%= link_to "Ask a new question", ask_path%>
