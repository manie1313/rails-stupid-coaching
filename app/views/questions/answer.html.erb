<%# The answer.html.erb will display the question you ask your coach
as well as the coachâ€™s answer. The controller will need to read the question
 from params and compute an instance
variable @answer for the view to display.
 Here are two requests that you should be able to handle: %>

<%# <erb>@question</erb>
<erb>@answer</erb> %>

<%= @question  %>
<%= @answer %>
